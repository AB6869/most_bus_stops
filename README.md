# React + TypeScript + Vite

The project is created by `$ npm create vite@latest`.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Dependencies

- react-query is used to fetch
- added proxy server in vite.config.ts to bypass CORS issues
- styled-components is used for styling the elements

## How to run the project

- clone the project and cd bus-stops
- npm install
- npm run dev
- Press the o key to open the application in your web browser
